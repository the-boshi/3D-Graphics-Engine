# 3D-Graphics_Engine

This is a 3D graphics engine module and program.
Given a .obj file containing the vertex data for a triangle mesh in 3D space, the program will project it onto a 2D screen with simple lighting.
It also allows the user to move around in space, turn the camera around, and rotate/translate the mesh.
The program is written entirely in C and is only dependent on the SDL2 development library.
