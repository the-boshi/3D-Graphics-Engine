# 3D Graphics Engine

This is a 3D graphics engine module and program. <br>
Given a .obj file containing the vertex data for a triangle mesh in 3D space, the program will project it onto a 2D screen with simple lighting. <br>
It also allows the user to move around in space, turn the camera around, and rotate/translate the mesh. <br>
The program is written entirely in C and only depends on the SDL2 development library. <br>
